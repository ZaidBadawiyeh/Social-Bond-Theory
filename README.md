# Strengthening Social Bonds: A Path to Safer and Healthier Communities

This Repository holds the data, code, and analysis for a project I did that explores social bond theory in a real world scenario. The code combines public data on covid cases and crime rates during 2021 to explore relationships between shared experiences and better quality of life. This is a 
project I did fairly recently (2024 at the time of writing) that shows my ability to manipulate complex datasets to determine information that is 
applicable to legitimate questions. Many of my larger projects focus on social analysis, as is one of my diverse interests. I find this to be a great
example of my ability to combine complex information and make actionable recommendations based on the trends discovered. Attached to my code is an
OP-ED piece that explores the relevance of my findings and my suggestions for improving societal wellbeing. The analysis uncovers noteworthy trends and correlation to shared experiences and the decrease in crime against people and property in a region. I use these discoveries to make a case that Social Bond theory is accurate and through the increase of common spaces and community events, which artificially forge shared experiences, we can
improve societal wellbeing and decrease crime rates. Have a look at my study, the data used, and the code behind it to learn more!
